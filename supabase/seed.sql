-- Seed file for AI Fitness Coach
-- This file contains sample data for testing purposes

-- Note: User profiles will be automatically created via the trigger when users sign up
-- This seed file mainly contains reference data and sample AI recommendations

-- Sample fitness goals (these could be used in a dropdown)
-- INSERT INTO public.fitness_goals (name, description) VALUES
-- ('weight_loss', 'Lose weight and reduce body fat'),
-- ('muscle_gain', 'Build muscle mass and strength'),
-- ('endurance', 'Improve cardiovascular endurance'),
-- ('strength', 'Increase overall strength'),
-- ('flexibility', 'Improve flexibility and mobility'),
-- ('general_fitness', 'Maintain overall health and fitness');

-- Sample dietary restrictions (these could be used in a dropdown)
-- INSERT INTO public.dietary_restrictions (name, description) VALUES
-- ('vegetarian', 'No meat or fish'),
-- ('vegan', 'No animal products'),
-- ('gluten_free', 'No gluten-containing foods'),
-- ('dairy_free', 'No dairy products'),
-- ('keto', 'Ketogenic diet - low carb, high fat'),
-- ('paleo', 'Paleolithic diet'),
-- ('mediterranean', 'Mediterranean diet pattern');

-- For now, we'll keep the seed file minimal since user data will be created through signup
-- and the application will handle populating user-specific data through the UI

-- You can add more seed data here as needed for testing
