- **Offline Capability**: Core functionality works without internet connection ✅
- **Optimized Camera**: Fast, intuitive photo capture with guidance ✅
- **Quick Actions**: Reduce meal logging to <30 seconds ✅
- **Performance**: <3s load time, <1s photo capture ✅

### Success Metrics
- PWA installation rate >30%
- Photo capture completion rate >90%
- Average meal logging time <30 seconds
- Lighthouse PWA score >90

## Technical Architecture

### PWA Architecture
```
Next.js App → Service Worker → IndexedDB (offline) → Supabase (online sync)
```

### Camera Pipeline
```
Camera Stream → Optimized Capture → Image Processing → AI Analysis → Quick Edit
```

### Quick Actions System
```
Gesture/Voice → Action Router → Background Processing → UI Feedback
```
